/// Reason we DON'T use SetProp (and the reason we DO use SetClientProp)
/// Changing the mission's name using SetProp will give undesired results.
/// By changing the mission name using SetProp, beating the mission's last wave will not reset the mission after all waves are completed.
/// Instead, it will conclude the mission normally, but switch to whichever mission is next in the mapcycle.txt of the server.
