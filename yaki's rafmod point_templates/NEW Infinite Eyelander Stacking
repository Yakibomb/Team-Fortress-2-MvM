///////////////////////////////////////////////////

/// How this works
/// Killing with the Eyelander will trigger a relay that recalculates the health and speed of the Eyelander user.
/// This version only gives +5 max health and +1% move speed per head. Standard Eyelander is +15 health and +7% speed per head, up to 4.

/// This method uses Expressions (https://sigwiki.potato.tf/index.php/Expressions)
/// Using expressions here eliminates like, 90% of the lines to produce the same result.


/// Paste this point template somewhere outside of the "Wave" brackets so the game always has access to it.
